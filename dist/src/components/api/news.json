We'll good news, because we love giving away free Bingo Cards as much as you love receiving them! It's possible that you'll receive free Bingo cards as a gift when you sign in, or you might win them during a quiz or giveaway.<br><br>We've received lots of questions on how to use free Bingo Cards, which is why we thought it be helpful to provide you with a little bit more information. If you received free Bingo Cards, you can recognize them by their color. Your free cards are green instead of yellow. The green cards mean that they won't cost you any additional Coins when you click to play. However, if your cards are yellow, it means that they will cost you additional Coins to play.<br><br>You can find all your Bingo Cards in the grey navigation bar right next to the Collections icon. Here, your cards (both purchased and received) are organized by room value. This is a great way to find out how many Bingo Cards you still have left to play with.<br><br>Another important thing worth mentioning is that your Bingo Cards can\u2019t be exchanged for Coins. Once you\u2019ve received your Bingo Cards, they will stay in your inventory until you decide to play them. We hope this answers all your questions about free Bingo Cards. Just remember, a green card = a free card!","publicationDate":1600848000,"likes":{"amount":2449,"hasLiked":false}},{"id":329401,"title":"LeenD13","headerThumb":"https:\/\/images.gamepoint.tech\/ingamenews\/gpinternational\/329401\/thumb\/imagethumb_1600677633.png","shortSummary":"LeenD13 is our VIP of the Week!","headerImage":"https:\/\/images.gamepoint.tech\/ingamenews\/gpinternational\/329401\/header\/imageheader_1600677633.png","body":"Congratulations <b>LeenD13<\/b> you are our new VIP of the Week!

This is your chance! We\u2019re not only doing exclusive interviews with our employees, but we also want to get to know our players better! This is why we will do these interviews regularly.<br><br>Today we spoke with Eric_Renes<br><br><b>#1 What\u2019s your name and how long have you been playing on GamePoint?<\/b><br><br>My name is Eric and I\u2019ve been playing on SpelPunt\/GamePoint for about 12 years.<br><br><b>#2 What\u2019s your favorite GamePoint game?<\/b><br><br>That used to be Klaverjassen, but now my favorite games are GamePoint Bingo and GamePoint Casino<br><br><b>#3 What are your hobbies besides GamePoint?<\/b><br><br>Besides playing on GamePoint (which I do on both my laptop and mobile), I like to ride my bicycle and I love to watch shows and movies on Netflix.<br><br><b>#4 If you were a movie character, who\u2019d you be and why?<\/b><br><br>Oh, that\u2019s a hard question. I\u2019ve never thought about that, but I think I\u2019d be Danny Zucko. At the time that Grease was playing in movie theaters, I was a little bit like that. Now, I\u2019ve changed a bit, but I can still see myself in some things that he did.<br><br><b>#5 Can you tell us a fun fact about yourself?<\/b><br><br>I always used to babysit my neighbors\u2019 children. Even now, after I moved, we still keep in touch.<br><br><b>#6 What is your favorite GamePoint event or show?<\/b><br><br>The Live Giveaways on Facebook! I love the interaction between the players and the employees, because you can actually see real people at work!<br><br><b>#7 Can you share your favorite GamePoint memory with us?<\/b><br><br>It\u2019s been a while, when GamePoint was still SpelPunt, but with Sinterklaas I won 1-year VIP!<br><br><b>#8 What message would you like to give to your fellow players?<\/b><br><br>Let\u2019s work together to keep GamePoint fun. It\u2019s just a game and everyone wins and loses sometimes.<br><br><b>#9 Do you have any feedback for GamePoint?<\/b><br><br>No, not really, but maybe to hire more players, who are often online, as hosts, to have more eyes in the chat, because sometimes it\u2019s not fun to read what's being said in the chat.<br><br><b>#10 What player or employee should be interviewed in the future and why?<\/b><br><br>I would like to see Jacky97 get interviewed. I think she\u2019s been playing on GamePoint for a long time as well and I\u2019m very curious to hear about her experiences.<br><br>Would you like a chance to be interviewed by us? Let one of our employees know in the chat or contact support.<br><br>We hope you enjoyed this content and look forward to seeing you at the next interview!","publicationDate":1594713600,"likes":{"amount":3355,"hasLiked":true}}]}
